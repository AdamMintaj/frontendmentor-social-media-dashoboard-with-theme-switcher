# Frontend Mentor - Social media dashboard with theme switcher solution

## Overview

This repository holds my solution to the [Social media dashboard with theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challnge here was to create an optimal layout for the site depending on the user's device's screen size, enable hover states for all interactive elements and build a toggle theme switch.

## How it went

This challenge was fun to do, although not very demanding js-wise. The coolest thing was designing the color themes, which I did with scss mixins. They were also pretty useful, alongside with scss @extend, while styling many repeatable elements in this challenge. Css grid was kind enough to then glue all that together.
